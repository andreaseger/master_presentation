### what further development could achieve

- active learning instead of passive/bulk learning
    - as seen on the SVM page only the vectors closest to the hyperplane are interesting
    - this could eliminate the need of a extra training phase as the system can be trained as it runs

- higher level text analysis of the job description the extract specific parts
