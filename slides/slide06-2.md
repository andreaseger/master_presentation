### what further projects could be build on this architecture

- automated classifications, **but** we need a loot more data for that
- come other places where we have enough data which can be placed into seperate classes

some wild ideas:

- how likely will a user buy the product based on his profile data
- better search based on previous searches and what a user did with the results
