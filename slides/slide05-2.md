### pros

- "obvious" errors will be fixed before the job goes live
- faster error fixing
- more jobs can benefit from the system

### cons

- researcher/approver probably won't challange the prediction if it was correct the first few times
- will interfere the training data, because those jobs will then appear as qualified correct on first attempt
